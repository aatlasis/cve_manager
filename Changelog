You can query (offline) the database and get:
- details about specific CVE including affected products (as CPEs) and CWEs (ie related weaknesses).
- the affected CWE and get info about consequences, potential mitigations, etc.
- list all CVEs greater than a score, published after a specific date, applicable to specific products (based on CPEs), or any combination of the above, and extract them (optionally) to  CSV files for further processing.
